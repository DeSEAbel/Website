      <h1>About </h1>
      <h2 style="width:70%;">
        DeSEAbel is a free and open source application developed to adapt human activities
        to reduce the volume of noise in the oceans.
      </h2>
      <h3 style="width:70%;">
        <span style="color: #214a67">
          The application is intended to be continually improved by a community of motivated individuals who share a common interest in ecology.

          With this tool, we aim to raise awareness of the impact of noise in the
          ocean while providing a decision support tool to limit the ecological
          impact of various activities, whether on an individual, corporate or
          governmental scale.

    <h1>Our motivations</h1>

        <p>
          Since 2005, the United Nations has recognized underwater noise from human
           activities as a source of marine pollution and a threat to marine ecosystems.
            In France, underwater noise has been recognized as a source of pollution 
            since 2010, but no restrictions have yet been put in place. In the oceans,
            there is a diversity of sounds related to physical phenomena (earthquakes, 
            volcanic activity, waves, ice melting), fauna communication and anthropic 
            activities (maritime traffic, offshore activities, sonar, port activities).
            Communication is an essential element for marine fauna to survive and 
            reproduce in the ocean and for a part of the species and especially the 
            marine mammals of the beaches. especially the marine mammals, with a wide
            range of frequencies to communicate, to orient themselves, to communicate,
            to orient themselves, to find their food, to avoid predators, to detect 
            predators, to detect mates, to locate rivals or to maintain the cohesion 
            of the group. or to maintain the cohesion of the group.

          Humans have significantly altered the soundscape of the oceans. Maritime
          traffic roughly doubled between 1950 and 2000. Vessel traffic adds 3 decibels
          to the sound level of the oceans every 10 years, posing a major threat to
          aquatic life. Numerous studies have shown a variety of effects on marine 
          species associated with this noise pollution: hearing loss, increased stress,
          loss of feeding ability, difficulty reproducing or responding to predators, 
          and even mass die-offs of species in front of a major noise source.
